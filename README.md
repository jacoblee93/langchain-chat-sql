# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain + Next.js Starter Template

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template)
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flangchain-ai%2Flangchain-nextjs-template)

This template scaffolds a LangChain.js + Next.js starter app. It showcases how to use and combine LangChain modules for several
use cases. Specifically:

- [Simple chat](/app/api/chat/route.ts)
- [Returning structured output from an LLM call](/app/api/chat/structured_output/route.ts)
- [Answering complex, multi-step questions with agents](/app/api/chat/agents/route.ts)
- [Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with a chain and a vector store](/app/api/chat/retrieval/route.ts)
- [Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with an agent and a vector store](/app/api/chat/retrieval_agents/route.ts)

Most of them use Vercel's [AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai) to stream tokens to the client and display the incoming messages.

## üöÄ Getting Started

First, clone this repo and download it locally.

Next, you'll need to set up environment variables in your repo's `.env.local` file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`.
To start with the basic examples, you'll just need to add your OpenAI API key.

Next, install the required packages using your preferred package manager (e.g. `yarn`).

Now you're ready to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result! Ask the bot something and you'll see a streamed response:

![A streaming conversation between the user and the AI](/public/images/chat-conversation.png)

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Backend logic lives in `app/api/chat/route.ts`. From here, you can change the prompt and model, or add other modules and logic.

## üß± Structured Output

The second example shows how to have a model return output according to a specific schema using OpenAI Functions.
Click the `Structured Output` link in the navbar to try it out:

![A streaming conversation between the user and an AI agent](/public/images/structured-output-conversation.png)

The chain in this example uses a [popular library called Zod](https://zod.dev) to construct a schema, then formats it in the way OpenAI expects.
It then passes that schema as a function into OpenAI and passes a `function_call` parameter to force OpenAI to return arguments in the specified format.

For more details, [check out this documentation page](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/popular/structured_output).

## ü¶ú Agents

To try out the agent example, you'll need to give the agent access to the internet by populating the `SERPAPI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.
Head over to [the SERP API website](https://serpapi.com/) and get an API key if you don't already have one.

You can then click the `Agent` example and try asking it more complex questions:

![A streaming conversation between the user and an AI agent](/public/images/agent-conversation.png)

This example uses the OpenAI Functions agent, but there are a few other options you can try as well.
See [this documentation page for more details](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/).

## üê∂ Retrieval

The retrieval examples both use Supabase as a vector store. However, you can swap in
[another supported vector store](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/) if preferred by changing
the code under `app/api/retrieval/ingest/route.ts`, `app/api/chat/retrieval/route.ts`, and `app/api/chat/retrieval_agents/route.ts`.

For Supabase, follow [these instructions](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/supabase) to set up your
database, then get your database URL and private key and paste them into `.env.local`.

You can then switch to the `Retrieval` and `Retrieval Agent` examples. The default document text is pulled from the LangChain.js retrieval
use case docs, but you can change them to whatever text you'd like.

For a given text, you'll only need to press `Upload` once. Pressing it again will re-ingest the docs, resulting in duplicates.
You can clear your Supabase vector store by navigating to the console and running `DELETE FROM docuemnts;`.

After splitting, embedding, and uploading some text, you're ready to ask questions!

For more info on retrieval chains, [see this page](https://js.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/).
The specific variant of the conversational retrieval chain used here is composed using LangChain Expression Language, which you can
[read more about here](https://js.langchain.com/docs/guides/expression_language/cookbook). This chain example will also return cited sources
via header in addition to the streaming response.

For more info on retrieval agents, [see this page](https://js.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents).

## üìö Learn More

The example chains in the `app/api/chat/route.ts` and `app/api/chat/retrieval/route.ts` files use
[LangChain Expression Language](https://js.langchain.com/docs/guides/expression_language/interface) to
compose different LangChain modules together. You can integrate other retrievers, agents, preconfigured chains, and more too, though keep in mind
`BytesOutputParser` is meant to be used directly with model output.

To learn more about what you can do with LangChain.js, check out the docs here:

## ‚ñ≤ Deploy on Vercel

When ready, you can deploy your app on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
